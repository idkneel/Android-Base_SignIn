During my college internship, I created a simple sign in page in order to demonstrate and give students a basis on how to start and the bare bones basics on how to setup firebase authentication

Firebase is the cloud base I chose for this as android studio has very good built in dependencies and setup for integrating firebase into projects as it can even so some simple steps for you
This program is written in Java, however the basis is the same of you were to change the language in Android Studio to Kotlin as the function and the base setup is still relatively close.
